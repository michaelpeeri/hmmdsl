hmmdsl - Library for HMMs and HSMMs
===================================

This library implements Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Hidden semi-Markov Models (HSMMs).
The models are implemented in C++, and are exposed as a python extension.
Algorithms include Viterbi alignment and Baum-Welch learning.
The C++ implementation uses the _generic programming_  paradigm, and relies heavily on the Boost libraries.

Maturity: Basic functionality is working, but code is still being developed and tested, so don't use for any important purpose.
